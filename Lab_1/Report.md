# **Vehicle Configuration Project Report**

---

## **Project Overview**

This project implements **three design patterns**: **Singleton**, **Builder**, and **Prototype**. These patterns are used to manage the creation, configuration, and cloning of vehicles within a vehicle showroom system. The goal is to allow users to configure a vehicle step-by-step, reuse vehicle configurations efficiently, and ensure only one showroom instance is used throughout the application.

## **Design Patterns Used**

### 1. **Singleton Pattern**

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that only one instance of a class is created and shared throughout the application. This is applied to the `showRoom` class to ensure that only one showroom instance is used.

#### **Implementation Details:**
- **Class:** `showRoom`
- **Key Elements:**
  - Uses the `__new__()` method to ensure a single instance.
  - Uses `hasattr()` in `__init__()` to prevent re-initialization.

### 3. **Prototype Pattern**

The **Prototype Pattern** allows creating new objects by **cloning existing ones**. This is useful when creating a new object is costly or when objects share similar configurations.

#### **Implementation Details:**
- **Class:** `VehiclePrototype`
- **Product:** `Vehicle`
- **Key Features:**
  - Uses **deep copying** to clone the original object.
  - Allows creating multiple vehicles with similar attributes efficiently.


## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the effective use of **Singleton**, **Builder**, and **Prototype patterns** to create a flexible, reusable, and modular vehicle configuration system. Each pattern plays a distinct role in achieving different design goals:

- **Singleton Pattern** ensures that only one instance of the `showRoom` class is used throughout the application, maintaining consistency across all operations.
- **Builder Pattern** allows step-by-step construction of a `Vehicle` object, making it easy to configure and modify vehicles with method chaining.
- **Prototype Pattern** simplifies the creation of new vehicle instances by **cloning existing ones**, reducing the need for repetitive configuration and initialization.

### **How the Patterns Complement Each Other:**
- **Singleton** ensures that a single showroom instance handles all operations, reducing redundancy.
- **Builder** provides a structured way to assemble vehicles incrementally with customization options.
- **Prototype** offers an efficient method to duplicate vehicles, supporting configurations that are similar but slightly different.

This combination of patterns results in:
1. **Scalable and Maintainable Code**: 
   - Easily extend the system with new vehicle types or components.
2. **Efficient Object Creation**:
   - Clone and reuse objects instead of building them repeatedly.
3. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - Each pattern focuses on a specific responsibility, improving modularity.

With this design, the project ensures an elegant solution for managing vehicle configurations in a way that is efficient, consistent, and easy to maintain.
